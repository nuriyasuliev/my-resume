# Here we are defining a variable
time = 10

# below is the if else conditional statement
if time > 12: # 10 > 12 ? True or False => False, okay I will go to next condition
    print('Time to sleep') # skip this
elif time ==11: # 10 == 11 ? True or False => False, okay I'll go to necy condition
    print('Too early') # skip
else: # else means if all the above confitions are False then do this
    print('its time')
