# Here we are defining a variable
time = 11

# below is the if else conditional statement
if time > 12: # 11 > 12 ? True or False => False, okay I will go to next condition
    print('Time to sleep') # skip this
elif time ==11: # 11 == 11 ? True or False => True, okay I'll run the below code
    print('Too early') # run this code
else: # skip this
    print('its time') # skip this

print('If else statement is over')
